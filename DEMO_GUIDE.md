## 📱 Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
```
"Hi! I'm [Name], and today I'll show you KlaB Dashboard - 
a production-ready authentication system I built using 
React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This isn't just 
another login form - it's an enterprise-grade solution 
with real API integration and modern security practices."
```

### Feature Showcase (2 minutes)
```
"Let me show you the key features that make this special:

First, real-time validation - watch as I type an invalid 
email... see the instant feedback? The system validates 
email format and password requirements immediately.

Second, loading states - when I click login, notice the 
button changes to 'Logging in...' and becomes disabled. 
This prevents double submissions and gives clear feedback.

Third, error handling - let me simulate a network error... 
see how it gracefully handles failures with clear messages?"
```

### Technical Deep Dive (3 minutes)
```
"Now let's look under the hood. Here's the Redux store 
configuration with our auth slice. Notice how we use 
createAsyncThunk for handling API calls with proper 
loading and error states.

The API integration is centralized in this config file, 
making it easy to switch between development and production 
endpoints. Everything is properly typed with TypeScript.

Security is paramount - JWT tokens are securely stored, 
validated on each request, and properly cleaned up on logout."
```

### Live Demo (2 minutes)
```
"Let's see it in action. I'll log in with valid credentials...
Perfect! Notice the smooth transition and user feedback.

Now let me refresh the page... see how the session persists? 
The token is validated automatically.

Finally, let me log out... the token is securely removed 
and we're back to the login screen."
```

### Closing (30 seconds)
```
"This demonstrates a complete, production-ready authentication 
system with modern development practices. The code is 
well-documented, fully typed, and ready for enterprise use. 
Thanks for watching!"
```
